## Blog app

Simple Django project from William S. Vincent's [Django for beginners](https://djangoforbeginners.com/) book. Using the Django admin and forms we can create, edit, or delete the content. We used DetailView, CreateView, UpdateView and DeleteView to accomplish that for each blog post entry. We made test cases for each functionality using TestCase. Also, I added Whitenoise for serving static files in production.
